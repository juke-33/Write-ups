## In this challenge, you can access to an fileSharing service. The flag is stored in /flag/flag.txt. Will you be able to get it?

Seached for the path that the files are stored.

Found about the /documents.

Started searching the files while i found yoyo.php that gave me a terminal.

With this command i printed the flag.
```
cat /flag/flag.txt
```
