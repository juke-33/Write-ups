## Challenge

what-flag

NICC recieved a mysterious email with an executable file that does nothing. Can you figure out what this executable does?

## Solution

The ELF contained the functions u, h, h2, f, l, a, g.

Each one had some hex wich was part of the flag.

Decoded and combined them and got the flag.


Flag: `NICC{uhH_fl@g_i_ThInk}`
