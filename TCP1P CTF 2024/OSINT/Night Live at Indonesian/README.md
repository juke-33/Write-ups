## Solution

If we open the given zip file, we can find 5 photos and 1 txt file.

We open the txt we notice a facebook [link](https://www.facebook.com/stacy.putri?mibextid=LQQJ4d).

The 5 photos seem to be all from a club, while the facebook page is about clubbing.

We tried and found the photos on different albums on the page in these are the links where i found them:

[album 1](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1009530329189&type=3)

[album 2](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1014241726971&type=3)

[album 3](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1009005436067&type=3)

These 3 albums had one thing in common, the Stadium Jakarta. 

According to the description this place has to be closed 10+ years ago so we searched the reason it closed and found [this](https://www.vice.com/en/article/cop-dies-at-infamous-jakarta-stadium-club-shutdown-imminent/) site.

In the article they are talking about a man "Purnana", who gave order to close the club.

His full name was the answer with his birth date.
