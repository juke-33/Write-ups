## Her-Eyes

### Medusa has a portrait of herself, the only way people will look at her. She decides to share it with you while saying something about herself but she doesn't want to tell you directly. She tells you everything is in the portrait.

I put the image on this [site](https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/steganography-encode-text-into-image/) and got this output:
```
Her 󠁎eyes 󠁉stare 󠁃at 󠁃you 󠁻watching 󠁟you 󠁎closely, 󠁡she 󠁭starts 󠁥crying 󠀱mourning 󠁟over 󠁎lost. 󠁡Two 󠁭people 󠁥walk 󠀲towards 󠁽her comforting her, they're the only one who belive. Two figures approach her, their presence a beacon of solace in the darkness that surrounds her. Family by blood or bond, they offer comfort to the grieving soul before them. With gentle hands and compassionate hearts, they cradle her in an embrace of understanding and support, as though they alone comprehend the depths of her pain and stand ready to bear it alongside her.
