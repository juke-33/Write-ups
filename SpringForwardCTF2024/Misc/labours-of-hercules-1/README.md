### I was sent this picture of the mighty Greek hero Hercules. However, something seems odd about it and I can't put my finger on it. Oh...I almost forgot this catchpharse was sent with the picture: n3m3anl10n.

- Solution

I put the Image on Aperi'Solve and the Steghide command found a flag.txt file. I opened it and it was saying: How many days/months did Hercules have to kill the create picture depicted here? So I searched this and got that he needed 30 days.
