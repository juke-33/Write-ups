### You have slayed the mighty Nemean Lion and skinned it for your armour. This other image was sent to me but some werid, cryptic message appeared and I can't seem to find it anymore.

- Solution

I put the image on this [site](https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html) and submitted it. It gave this output:
```
Wt o vsor wg qih ctt, hkc acfs gvozz hoys whg dzoqs.

Kvoh qfsohs sjsbhiozzm zsor hc hvs rsawgs ct Vsfoqizsg?
```

After that i put on [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher) and decrypted it:
```
If a head is cut off, two more shall take its place.

What create eventually lead to the demise of Heracules?
```

With a simple search I found "Lernean Hydra"
