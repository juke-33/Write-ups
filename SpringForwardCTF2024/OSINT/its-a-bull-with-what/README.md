### It has been said that the mighty Minotaur is found in the Aegean Sea on some palace. Can you help me find the island name and the palace name, so that I can slay it?

- Solution

From a simple search on the internet we can find the island and the palace. Even if I tried Knossos Palace it didn't seem to work so i was stuck there. Tried more Palaces but none of them also seem to work.
```
Knossos Palace
Minoan Palace
Phaistos Palace
Malia Palace
Galatas Palace
Zakros Palace
```
