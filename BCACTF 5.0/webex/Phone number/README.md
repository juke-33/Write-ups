# Phone number

## I was trying to sign into this website, but now it's asking me for a phone number. The way I'm supposed to input it is strange. Can you help me sign in?

## My phone number is 1234567890

Opened the website with Burp Suite.

Added some random numbers and clicked sumbit.

In the reqeuests i changed the numbers to the actual phone number.

I got the flag in the response headers.
