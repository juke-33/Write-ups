# Night

That was quite a pretty night view, can you find where I took it? Flag format: uiuctf{street name, city name} Example: uiuctf{East Green Street, Champaign}

Some words are blurred out to make the challenge harder, hopefully.

Flag format clarification: Use the full type, e.g. Avenue, Street, Road, etc., and include a space between the comma and city name.

## Solution

First of all we put the whole photo in lens, but didnt find anything useful.

So we thought that maybe we can locate the big tower in the middle of the photo.

We found that it was the Prudential Tower in Boston.

Searched and found the exact spot of the highway that is in the photo. (Massachusetts Turnpike)

The photo was taken above this road.
