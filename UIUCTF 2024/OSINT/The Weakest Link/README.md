# The Weakest Link

LISA and the secret business partner have a secret Spotify collaboration planned together. Unfortunately, neither of them have the opsec to keep it private. See if you can figure out what it is!

This is part three of a three-part OSINT suite including Hip With the Youth, An Unlikely Partnership, and The Weakest Link. I recommend starting with the other two challenges!

## Solution

The last profile we found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uiuc-chan/) had a phrase in the description about music.

So we opened spotify and searched for this username.

We found this [profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/31d2lcivqdieyl4qzx25vfmp6jt4?si=df331fc66cab4a3c).

If you follow it, you can see a tab with the music the user is listening.

We clicked and found this private [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1J2aZwN25HyZT7viJsNkxS?si=c2574bdbd7f44a9b) that had the flag.
